# IoC Containers

The two primary IoC containers in Spring are BeanFactory and ApplicationContext. ApplicationContext is actually a sub-interface of BeanFactory. It has all of BeanFactory's features plus more to better integrate with other parts of the Spring framework. ApplicationContext also has a number of more specific sub-interfaces and implementations, such as WebApplicationContext.
